# Physarum Maze Solver Web App

This web app provides an interactive visualization of the Physarum model, 
inspired by the paper published by [Tero et al. in 2007: "Rules for Biologically 
Inspired Adaptive Network Design"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930600289X). 
The purpose of this web app is to educate users about the remarkable problem-solving 
abilities of the Physarum polycephalum slime mold, and to provide a hands-on experience
in understanding how it adapts to find the shortest path in a maze-like environment.
